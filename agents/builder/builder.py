"""
Builder Agent — creates and deploys ephemeral AI agents on demand.

Receives builder_spec from the Planner (via Orchestrator) and:
1. Resolves tools from the semantic layer
2. Creates ephemeral agent with system_prompt + tools
3. Deploys as Docker container
4. Returns agent card for the Orchestrator to execute against
5. Cleans up after task completion

The build pipeline is registered as @agent.step() decorators in main.py
and injected as self.tool_graph by AbiCore.
